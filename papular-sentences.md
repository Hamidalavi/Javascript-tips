## **Difference**

- The two languages are different in many important ways."**JavaScript**" is as related to "**Java**" as "Butter" is to "Butterfly".

## Blame

- When developers encounter confusion, they usually blame the language instead of their lack of understanding.
- Those who do not understand anything. There are three kind of behaviors:
  - They **leave** it
  - They **destroy** it
  - They **make fun** of it
