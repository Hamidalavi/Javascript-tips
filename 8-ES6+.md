# Some **`ES6 & Beyond`** snippets to give you more information

If you've been writing JS for any length of time, odds are the syntax is pretty familiar to you. There are certainly many quirks, but overall it's a fairly reasonable and straightforward syntax that draws many similarities from other languages. However, **ES6** adds quite a few new syntactic forms that take some getting used to. In this chapter, we'll tour through them to find out what's in store.

**Tip**: At the time of this writing, some of the features discussed in this book have been implemented in various browsers (Firefox, Chrome, etc.), but some have only been partially implemented and many others have not been implemented at all. Your experience may be mixed trying these examples directly. If so, try them out with transpilers, as most of these features are covered by those tools. trying out **ES6**, as is the online REPL for the Babel transpiler <http://babeljs.io/repl>.

## Block-Scoped Declarations

You're probably aware that the fundamental unit of variable scoping in **JavaScript** has always been the `function`. If you needed to create a block of scope, the most prevalent way to do so other than a regular function declaration was the **immediately invoked function expression** (IIFE). For example:

```js
var hamid = 23;
(function IIFE() {
  var hamid = 24;
  console.log(hamid); // 24
})();

console.log(hamid); // 23
```

If you remove `var` from block, output will differrent. Because `hamid` referencing to `global hamid` (first `hamid` declaration):

```js
var hamid = 23;
(function IIFE() {
  hamid = 24;
  console.log(hamid); // 24
})();

console.log(hamid); // 24
```

## `let` Declarations/Initialization

However, we can now create declarations that are bound to any block, called **block scoping**. This means all we need is a pair of `{ .. }` to create a scope. Instead of using `var`, which always declares variables attached to the enclosing function (or global, if top level) scope, use `let`:

```js
let hamed = 23;

{
  let hamed = 24;
  console.log(hamed); // 24
}

console.log(hamed); // 23
```

It's not very common or idiomatic thus far in JS to use a standalone `{ .. }` block, but it's always been valid. And developers from other languages that have block scoping will readily recognize that pattern.

We believe this is the best way to create block-scoped variables, with a dedicated `{ .. }` block. Moreover, you should always put the `let` declaration(s) at the very top of that block. If you have more than one to declare, we'd recommend using just one `let`.

Stylistically, we even prefer to put the `{`, to make it clearer that this block is only for the purpose of declaring the scope for those variables.

```js
{
  let ali = 22, reza, majid, mehrdad, morteza;
}
```

There's another experimental (not standardized) form of the `let` declaration called the `let`-block, which looks like:

```js
let(ali = 22, reza, majid, mehrdad, morteza); {
  // do something
}
```

That form is what we call explicit block scoping, whereas the `let ..` declaration form that mirrors `var` is more implicit, as it kind of hijacks whatever `{ .. }` pair it's found in. Generally developers find explicit mechanisms a bit more preferable than implicit mechanisms, and We claim this is one of those cases.

If you compare the previous two snippet forms, they're very similar, and in our opinion both qualify stylistically as explicit block scoping. Unfortunately, the `let (..) { .. }` form, the most explicit of the options, was not adopted in **ES6**. That may be revisited post-**ES6**, but for now the former option is our best bet, **I** think.

Accessing a `let`-declared variable earlier than its `let ..` declaration/initialization causes an error, whereas with `var` declarations the ordering doesn't matter (except stylistically).Look below snippet:

```js
console.log(hamed); // undefined
console.log(hamid); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'hamid' before initialization

var hamed;
let hamid;
```

**Warning**: This `ReferenceError` from accessing too-early `let`-declared references is technically called a Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) error -- you're accessing a variable that's been declared but not yet initialized. This will not be the only time we see TDZ errors -- they crop up in several places in **ES6**. Also, note that **initialized** doesn't require explicitly assigning a value in your code, as `let hamid;` is totally valid. A variable that's not given an assignment at declaration time is assumed to have been assigned the `undefined` value, so `let hamid;` is the same as `let hamid = undefined;`. Explicit assignment or not, you cannot access `hamid` until the `let hamid` statement is run.

One last gotcha: `typeof` behaves differently with TDZ variables than it does with undeclared (or declared!) variables. For example:

```js
{
  // `hamed` is not declared
  if (typeof hamed === "undefined") {
    console.log("Yeah!");
  }

  // `hamid` is declared, but in its TDZ
  if (typeof hamid === "undefined") { // ReferenceError!
    // ..
  }

  // ..

  let hamid;
}
```

The `hamed` is not declared, so `typeof` is the only safe way to check for its existence or not. But `typeof hamid` throws the TDZ error because farther down in the code there happens to be a `let hamid` declaration.

Now it should be clearer why we insist that `let` declarations should all be at the top of their scope. That totally avoids the accidental errors of accessing too early. It also makes it more explicit when you look at the start of a block, any block, what variables it contains.

Your blocks (`if` statements, `while` loops, etc.) don't have to share their original behavior with scoping behavior. This explicitness on your part, which is up to you to maintain with discipline, will save you lots of refactor headaches and footguns down the line.
