# Some **`ES6 & Beyond`** snippets to give you more information

If you've been writing JS for any length of time, odds are the syntax is pretty familiar to you. There are certainly many quirks, but overall it's a fairly reasonable and straightforward syntax that draws many similarities from other languages. However, **ES6** adds quite a few new syntactic forms that take some getting used to. In this chapter, we'll tour through them to find out what's in store.

**Tip**: At the time of this writing, some of the features discussed in this book have been implemented in various browsers (Firefox, Chrome, etc.), but some have only been partially implemented and many others have not been implemented at all. Your experience may be mixed trying these examples directly. If so, try them out with transpilers, as most of these features are covered by those tools. trying out **ES6**, as is the online REPL for the Babel transpiler <http://babeljs.io/repl>.

## Block-Scoped Declarations

You're probably aware that the fundamental unit of variable scoping in **JavaScript** has always been the `function`. If you needed to create a block of scope, the most prevalent way to do so other than a regular function declaration was the **immediately invoked function expression** (IIFE). For example:

```js
var hamid = 23;
(function IIFE() {
  var hamid = 24;
  console.log(hamid); // 24
})();

console.log(hamid); // 23
```

If you remove `var` from block, output will differrent. Because `hamid` referencing to `global hamid` (first `hamid` declaration):

```js
var hamid = 23;
(function IIFE() {
  hamid = 24;
  console.log(hamid); // 24
})();

console.log(hamid); // 24
```

## `let` Declarations/Initialization

However, we can now create declarations that are bound to any block, called **block scoping**. This means all we need is a pair of `{ .. }` to create a scope. Instead of using `var`, which always declares variables attached to the enclosing function (or global, if top level) scope, use `let`:

```js
let hamed = 23;

{
  let hamed = 24;
  console.log(hamed); // 24
}

console.log(hamed); // 23
```

It's not very common or idiomatic thus far in JS to use a standalone `{ .. }` block, but it's always been valid. And developers from other languages that have block scoping will readily recognize that pattern.

We believe this is the best way to create block-scoped variables, with a dedicated `{ .. }` block. Moreover, you should always put the `let` declaration(s) at the very top of that block. If you have more than one to declare, we'd recommend using just one `let`.

Stylistically, we even prefer to put the `{`, to make it clearer that this block is only for the purpose of declaring the scope for those variables.

```js
{
  let ali = 22, reza, majid, mehrdad, morteza;
}
```

There's another experimental (not standardized) form of the `let` declaration called the `let`-block, which looks like:

```js
let(ali = 22, reza, majid, mehrdad, morteza); {
  // do something
}
```

That form is what we call explicit block scoping, whereas the `let ..` declaration form that mirrors `var` is more implicit, as it kind of hijacks whatever `{ .. }` pair it's found in. Generally developers find explicit mechanisms a bit more preferable than implicit mechanisms, and We claim this is one of those cases.

If you compare the previous two snippet forms, they're very similar, and in our opinion both qualify stylistically as explicit block scoping. Unfortunately, the `let (..) { .. }` form, the most explicit of the options, was not adopted in **ES6**. That may be revisited post-**ES6**, but for now the former option is our best bet, **I** think.

Accessing a `let`-declared variable earlier than its `let ..` declaration/initialization causes an error, whereas with `var` declarations the ordering doesn't matter (except stylistically).Look below snippet:

```js
console.log(hamed); // undefined
console.log(hamid); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'hamid' before initialization

var hamed;
let hamid;
```

**Warning**: This `ReferenceError` from accessing too-early `let`-declared references is technically called a Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) error -- you're accessing a variable that's been declared but not yet initialized. This will not be the only time we see TDZ errors -- they crop up in several places in **ES6**. Also, note that **initialized** doesn't require explicitly assigning a value in your code, as `let hamid;` is totally valid. A variable that's not given an assignment at declaration time is assumed to have been assigned the `undefined` value, so `let hamid;` is the same as `let hamid = undefined;`. Explicit assignment or not, you cannot access `hamid` until the `let hamid` statement is run.

One last gotcha: `typeof` behaves differently with TDZ variables than it does with undeclared (or declared!) variables. For example:

```js
{
  // `hamed` is not declared
  if (typeof hamed === "undefined") {
    console.log("Yeah!");
  }

  // `hamid` is declared, but in its TDZ
  if (typeof hamid === "undefined") { // ReferenceError!
    // ..
  }

  // ..

  let hamid;
}
```

The `hamed` is not declared, so `typeof` is the only safe way to check for its existence or not. But `typeof hamid` throws the TDZ error because farther down in the code there happens to be a `let hamid` declaration.

Now it should be clearer why we insist that `let` declarations should all be at the top of their scope. That totally avoids the accidental errors of accessing too early. It also makes it more explicit when you look at the start of a block, any block, what variables it contains.

Your blocks (`if` statements, `while` loops, etc.) don't have to share their original behavior with scoping behavior. This explicitness on your part, which is up to you to maintain with discipline, will save you lots of refactor headaches and footguns down the line.

## `let` + `for`

The only exception we'd make to the preference for the explicit form of `let` declaration blocking is a `let` that appears in the header of a `for` loop. The reason may seem nuanced, but we believe it to be one of the more important **ES6** features. Consider:

```js
var funcs = [];
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  funcs.push(function () {
    console.log(i);
  });
}

funcs[4](); // 4
```

The `let i` in the `for` header declares an `i` not just for the `for` loop itself, but it redeclares a new `i` for each iteration of the loop. That means that closures created inside the loop iteration close over those per-iteration variables the way you'd expect.

If you tried that same snippet but with `var i` in the `for` loop header, you'd get `5` instead of `4`, because there'd only be one `i` in the outer scope that was closed over, instead of a new `i` for each iteration's function to close over. You could also have accomplished the same thing slightly more verbosely:

```js
var funcs = [];
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  let j = i;
  funcs.push(function () {
    console.log(j);
  });
}

funcs[4](); // 4
```

Wihout `let j`:

```js
var funcs = [];
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  funcs.push(function () {
    console.log(i);
  });
}

funcs[4](); // 5
```

Here (previous code), we forcibly create a new `j` for each iteration, and then the closure works the same way. We prefer the former approach; that extra special capability is why We endorse the `for (let .. ) ..` form. It could be argued it's somewhat more implicit, but it's explicit enough, and useful enough, for our tastes.

`let` also works the same way with `for..in` and `for..of` loops.

## `const` Declarations

There's one other form of block-scoped declaration to consider: the `const`, which creates constants.

What exactly is a constant? It's a variable that's read-only after its initial value is set. Consider:

```js
const hamid = 23;
console.log(hamid); // 23
hamid = 24; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
```

You are not allowed to change the value the variable holds once it's been set, at declaration time. A `const` declaration must have an explicit initialization. If you wanted a constant with the `undefined` value, you'd have to declare `const hamid = undefined` to get it.

Constants are not a restriction on the value itself, but on the variable's assignment of that value. In other words, the value is not frozen or immutable because of `const`, just the assignment of it. If the value is complex, such as an object or array, the contents of the value can still be modified:

```js
const hamid = [1, 2, 3, 4];
hamid.push(5);
console.log(hamid); // [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
hamid = 23; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
```

The `hamid` variable doesn't actually hold a constant array; rather, it holds a constant reference to the array. The array itself is freely mutable.

**Warning**: Assigning an object or array as a constant means that value will not be able to be garbage collected until that constant's lexical scope goes away, as the reference to the value can never be unset. That may be desirable, but be careful if it's not your intent!

**Tip**: We recommend to use UPPERCASE in `const` like `const HAMID`.

`const` can be used with variable declarations of `for`, `for..in`, and `for..of` loops. However, an error will be thrown if there's any attempt to reassign, such as the typical `i++` clause of a `for` loop.

---

There's some rumored assumptions that a `const` could be more optimizable by the **JavaScript** engine in certain scenarios than a `let` and `var` would be. Theoretically, the engine more easily knows the variable's value/type will never change, so it can eliminate some possible tracking.

Whether`const` really helps here or this is just our own fantasies and intuitions, the much more important decision to make is if you intend constant behavior or not. Remember: one of the most important roles for source code is to communicate clearly, not only to you, but your future self and other code collaborators, what is your intent is.

Some developers prefer to start out every variable declaration as a `const` and then relax a declaration back to a `let` if it becomes necessary for its value to change in the code. This is an interesting perspective, but it's not clear that it genuinely improves the readability or reason-ability of code.

**Our advice**: To avoid potentially confusing code, only use `const` for variables that you're intentionally and obviously signaling will not change. In other words, don't rely on `const` for code behavior, but instead use it as a tool for signaling intent, when intent can be signaled clearly.

## Block-scoped Functions

Look below snippets:

```js
{
  hamid(); // "Persian Sight"

  function hamid() {
    console.log("Persian Sight");
  }
}

hamid(); // "Persian Sight"
```

```js
"use strict"
{
  hamid(); // "Persian Sight"

  function hamid() {
    console.log("Persian Sight");
  }
}

hamid(); // ReferenceError: hamid is not defined
```

The `hamid()` function is declared inside the `{ .. }` block, and as of **ES6** is block-scoped there. So it's not available outside that block. But also note that it is "hoisted" within the block, as opposed to `let` declarations, which suffer the TDZ error trap mentioned earlier.

Block-scoping of function declarations could be a problem if you've ever written code like this before, and relied on the old legacy non-block-scoped behavior:

```js
if (true) {
  function hamed() {
    console.log("1");
  }
}
else {
  function hamed() {
    console.log("2");
  }
}

hamed(); // "1"
```

In pre-**ES6** environments, `hamed()` would print `"2"` regardless of the value of `true` (or other conditions), because both function declarations were hoisted out of the blocks, and the second one always wins.

In **ES6**, that last line throws a `ReferenceError` (if use `strict`).

## Spread/Rest

**ES6** introduces a new `...` operator that's typically referred to as the spread or rest operator, depending on where/how it's used. Let's take a look:

```js
function hamid(a, b, c) {
  console.log(a + b + c);
}

hamid(...[21, 22, 23]); // 66
```

When `...` is used in front of an array (actually, any iterable) it acts to **spread** it out into its individual values.

You'll typically see that usage as is shown in that previous snippet, when spreading out an array as a set of arguments to a function call. In this usage, `...` acts to give us a simpler syntactic replacement for the `apply()` method, which we would typically have used pre-**ES6** as:

```js
hamid.apply(null, [21, 22, 23]); // 66
```

But `...` can be used to spread out/expand a value in other contexts as well, such as inside another array declaration:

```js
let hamed = [2, 3, 4];
let hamid = [1, ...hamed, 5];
console.log(hamid); // [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
```

In this usage, `...` is basically replacing `concat(..)` , as it behaves like `[1].concat(hamed, [5])` here.

The other common usage of `...` can be seen as essentially the opposite; instead of spreading a value out, the `...` gathers a set of values together into an array. Consider:

```js
function hamed(a, b, ...c) {
  console.log(a, b, c);
}

hamed(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8); // 1 2 [ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ]
```

The `...c` in this snippet is essentially saying: "gather the rest of the arguments (if any) into an array called `c`". Because `a` was assigned `1`, and `b` was assigned `2`, the rest of the arguments `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7` and `8` were gathered into `c`.

Of course, if you don't have any named parameters, the `...` gathers all arguments:

```js
function hamid(...args) {
  console.log(args);
}

hamid(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8); // [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ]
```

**Note**: The `...args` in the `hamid(..)` function declaration is usually called **rest parameters**, because you're collecting the rest of the parameters. We prefer **gather**, because it's more descriptive of what it does rather than what it contains.

## Default Parameter Values

Perhaps one of the most common idioms in **JavaScript** relates to setting a default value for a function parameter. The way we've done this for years should look quite familiar:

```js
function defaultValue(a, b) {
  a = a || 15;
  b = b || 8;
  console.log(a + b);
}

defaultValue(); // 23
defaultValue(3, 7); // 10
defaultValue(3); // 11
defaultValue(null, 7); // 22
```

Of course, if you've used this pattern before, you know that it's both helpful and a little bit dangerous, if for example you need to be able to pass in what would otherwise be considered a falsy value for one of the parameters. Consider:

```js
defaultValue(0, 7); // 22
```

Why answer is `22`? Because the `0` is falsy, and so the `a || 15` results in `15`, not the directly passed in `0`.

To fix this gotcha, some people will instead write the check more verbosely like this:

```js
function defaultValue(a, b) {
  a = (a !== undefined) ? a : 15;
  b = (b !== undefined) ? b : 8;
  console.log(a + b);
}

defaultValue(0, 23); // 23
defaultValue(undefined, 23); // 38
```

Of course, that means that any value except `undefined` can be directly passed in. However, `undefined` will be assumed to signal, "**I** didn't pass this in". That works great unless you actually need to be able to pass `undefined` in.

In that case, you could test to see if the argument is actually omitted, by it actually not being present in the `arguments`, array, perhaps like this:

```js
function defaultValue(a, b) {
  a = (0 in arguments) ? a : 11;
  b = (1 in arguments) ? b : 31; // NaN
  console.log(a + b);
}

defaultValue(4); // 35
defaultValue(4, undefined); // NaN
```

But how would you omit the first `a` argument without the ability to pass in any kind of value (not even `undefined`) that signals "I'm omitting this argument"?

`defaultValue(, 4)` is tempting, but it's invalid syntax. `defaultValue.apply(null,[, 4])` seems like it should do the trick, but `apply(..)`'s quirks here mean that the arguments are treated as `[undefined, 4]`, which of course doesn't omit.

We can now examine a nice helpful syntax added as of **ES6** to streamline the assignment of default values to missing arguments:

```js
function defaultValue(a = 15, b = 8) {
  console.log(a + b);
}

defaultValue(); // 23
defaultValue(3, 7); // 10
defaultValue(0, 23); // 23
console.log("-----");
defaultValue(3); // 11
defaultValue(3, undefined); // 11
defaultValue(3, null); // 3
console.log("-----");
defaultValue(undefined, 7); // 22
```

Notice the results and how they imply both subtle differences and similarities to the earlier approaches.

`a = 15` in a function declaration is more like `a !== undefined ? a : 15` than the much more common idiom `a || 15`, so you'll need to be careful in converting your pre-**ES6** code to this **ES6** default parameter value syntax.

**Note**: A rest/gather parameter (see **Spread/Rest**) cannot have a default value. So, while `function defaultValue(...vals=[1,2,3]) {` might seem an intriguing capability, it's not valid syntax. You'll need to continue to apply that sort of logic manually if necessary.

## Default Value Expressions

Function default values can be more than just simple values like `8`; they can be any valid expression, even a function call:

```js
let hamid = 23;

function hamed(a = hamid) {
  return a;
}

function ali(a = hamed(), b = (45 + hamid)) {
  console.log(a, b);
}

ali(); // 23 68
```

As you can see, the default value expressions are lazily evaluated, meaning they're only run if and when they're needed -- that is, when a parameter's argument is omitted or is `undefined`.

Look below code:

```js
let w = 1, z = 2;
function hamed(x = w + 1, y = x + 1, z = z + 1) {
  console.log(x, y, z);
}

hamed(); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'z' before initialization
```

The `w` in the `w + 1` default value expression looks for `w` in the formal parameters' scope, but does not find it, so the outer scope's `w` is used. Next, The `x` in the `x + 1` default value expression finds `x` in the formal parameters' scope, and luckily `x` has already been initialized, so the assignment to `y` works fine.

However, the `z`  in `z + 1` finds `z` as a not-yet-initialized-at-that-moment parameter variable, so it never tries to find the `z` from the outer scope.

As we mentioned in the **`let` Declaration** section earlier in this chapter, **ES6** has a TDZ, which prevents a variable from being accessed in its uninitialized state. As such, the `z + 1` default value expression throws a TDZ `ReferenceError` error.

Though it's not necessarily a good idea for code clarity, a default value expression can even be an inline function expression call -- commonly referred to as an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE):

```js
function hamid(a =
  (function (v) { return v + 15; })(8)
) {
  console.log(a);
}

hamid(); // 23
```

There will very rarely be any cases where an IIFE (or any other executed inline function expression) will be appropriate for default value expressions. If you find yourself tempted to do this, take a step back and reevaluate!

**Warning**: If the IIFE had tried to access the `a` identifier and had not declared its own `a`. this would also have been a TDZ error, just as discussed before.

## Destructuring

**ES6** introduces a new syntactic feature called destructuring, which may be a little less confusing if you instead think of it as structured assignment. To understand this meaning, consider:

```js
function hamed() {
  return [1, 2, 3];
}

let temp = hamed(),
  a = temp[0], b = temp[1], c = temp[2];

console.log(a, b, c); // 1 2 3
```

As you can see, we created a manual assignment of the values in the array that `hamed()` returns to individual variables `a`, `b` and `c`, and to do so we (unfortunately) needed the `temp` variable.

Similarly, we can do the following with objects:

```js
function hamid() {
  return {
    x: 4,
    y: 5,
    z: 6
  }
}

let temp = hamid(),
  x = temp.x, y = temp.y, z = temp.z;

console.log(x, y, z); // 4 5 6
```

The `temp.x` property value is assigned to the `x` variable, and likewise for `temp.y` to `y` and `temp.z` to `z`.

Manually assigning indexed values from an array or properties from an object can be thought of as structured assignment. **ES6** adds a dedicated syntax for destructuring, specifically array destructuring and object destructuring. This syntax eliminates the need for the `temp` variable in the previous snippets, making them much cleaner. Consider:

```js
let [a, b, c] = hamed();
console.log(a, b, c); // 1 2 3 | SyntaxError: Identifier 'a' has already been declared

let { x: x, y: y, z: z } = hamid();
console.log(x, y, z); // 4 5 6 | SyntaxError: Identifier 'a' has already been declared
```

You're likely more accustomed to seeing syntax like `[a,b,c]` on the righthand side of an `=` assignment, as the value being assigned.

Destructuring symmetrically flips that pattern, so that `[a,b,c]` on the lefthand side of the `=` assignment is treated as a kind of **pattern** for decomposing the righthand side array value into separate variable assignments.

```js
let { x, y, z } = hamid();
console.log(x, y, z); // 4 5 6
```

Pretty cool, isn't it?

But is `{ x, .. }` leaving off the `x:` part or leaving off the`: x` part? We're actually leaving off the `x:` part when we use the shorter syntax. That may not seem like an important detail, but you'll understand its importance in just a moment.

If you can write the shorter form, why would you ever write out the longer form? Because that longer form actually allows you to assign a property to a different variable name, which can sometimes be quite useful:

```js
let { x: bam, y: pam, z: jam } = hamid();
console.log(bam, pam, jam); // 4 5 6
console.log( x, y, z ); // 4 5 6 (ReferenceError in some browser)
```

There's a subtle but super-important quirk to understand about this variation of the object destructuring form. To illustrate why it can be a gotcha you need to be careful of, let's consider the **pattern** of how normal object literals are specified:

```js
let X = 10, Y = 20;
let o = { a: X, b: Y };
console.log(o.a, o.b); // 10 20
```

In `{ a: X, b: Y }`, we know that `a` is the object property, and `X` is the source value that gets assigned to it. In other words, the syntactic pattern is `target: source`, or more obviously, `property-alias: value`. We intuitively understand this because it's the same as `=` assignment, where the pattern is `target = source`.

However, when you use object destructuring assignment -- that is, putting the `{ .. }` object literal-looking syntax on the lefthand side of the `=` operator -- you invert that `target: source` pattern.

Recall:

```js
let { x: bam, y: pam, z: jam } = hamid();
```

The syntactic pattern here is `source: target` (or `value: variable-alias`). `x: bam` means the `x` property is the source value and `bam` is the target variable to assign to. In other words, object literals are `target <-- source`, and object destructuring assignments are `source --> target`. See how that's flipped?

There's another way to think about this syntax though, which may help ease the confusion. Consider:

```js
let aa = 10, bb = 20;
let o = { x: aa, y: bb };
let { x: AA, y: BB } = o;
console.log(aa, bb); // 10 20
console.log(AA, BB); // 10 20
```

In the `{ x: aa, y: bb }` line, the `x` and `y` represent the object properties. In the `{ x: AA, y: BB }` line, the `x` and the `y` also represent the object properties.

Recall how earlier we asserted that `{ x, .. }` was leaving off the `x:` part? In those two lines, if you erase the `x:` and `y:` parts in that snippet, you're left only with `aa, bb` and `AA, BB`, which in effect -- only conceptually, not actually -- are assignments from `aa` to `AA` and from `bb` to `BB`.

So, that symmetry may help to explain why the syntactic pattern was intentionally flipped for this **ES6** feature.

**Note**: We would have preferred the syntax to be `{ AA: x , BB: y }` for the destructuring assignment, as that would have preserved consistency of the more familiar `target: source` pattern for both usages. Alas, we having to train our brain for the inversion, as some readers may also have to do.

---

So far, we've used destructuring assignment with `let` declarations (of course, they could also use `var` and `const`), but destructuring is a general assignment operation, not just a declaration. Consider:

```js
let a, b, c, x, y, z;
[a, b, c] = hamed();
({ x, y, z } = hamid());
console.log(a, b, c); // 1 2 3
console.log(x, y, z); // 4 5 6
```

The variables can already be declared, and then the destructuring only does assignments (make TypeError error happened), exactly as we've already seen.
