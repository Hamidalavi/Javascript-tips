# Some **`ES6 & Beyond`** snippets to give you more information

If you've been writing JS for any length of time, odds are the syntax is pretty familiar to you. There are certainly many quirks, but overall it's a fairly reasonable and straightforward syntax that draws many similarities from other languages. However, ES6 adds quite a few new syntactic forms that take some getting used to. In this chapter, we'll tour through them to find out what's in store.

**Tip**: At the time of this writing, some of the features discussed in this book have been implemented in various browsers (Firefox, Chrome, etc.), but some have only been partially implemented and many others have not been implemented at all. Your experience may be mixed trying these examples directly. If so, try them out with transpilers, as most of these features are covered by those tools. trying out ES6, as is the online REPL for the Babel transpiler <http://babeljs.io/repl>.

## Block-Scoped Declarations

You're probably aware that the fundamental unit of variable scoping in **JavaScript** has always been the `function`. If you needed to create a block of scope, the most prevalent way to do so other than a regular function declaration was the **immediately invoked function expression** (IIFE). For example:

```js
var hamid = 23;
(function IIFE() {
  var hamid = 24;
  console.log(hamid); // 24
})();

console.log(hamid); // 23
```

If you remove `var` from block, output will differrent. Because `hamid` referencing to `global hamid` (first `hamid` declaration):

```js
var hamid = 23;
(function IIFE() {
  hamid = 24;
  console.log(hamid); // 24
})();

console.log(hamid); // 24
```

## `let` Declarations

However, we can now create declarations that are bound to any block, called **block scoping**. This means all we need is a pair of `{ .. }` to create a scope. Instead of using `var`, which always declares variables attached to the enclosing function (or global, if top level) scope, use `let`:

```js
let hamed = 23;

{
  let hamed = 24;
  console.log(hamed); // 24
}

console.log(hamed); // 23
```

It's not very common or idiomatic thus far in JS to use a standalone `{ .. }` block, but it's always been valid. And developers from other languages that have block scoping will readily recognize that pattern.

We believe this is the best way to create block-scoped variables, with a dedicated `{ .. }` block. Moreover, you should always put the `let` declaration(s) at the very top of that block. If you have more than one to declare, we'd recommend using just one `let`.

Stylistically, I even prefer to put the `{`, to make it clearer that this block is only for the purpose of declaring the scope for those variables.

```js
{
  let ali = 22, reza, majid, mehrdad, morteza;
}
```
